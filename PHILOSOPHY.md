The philosophy of Hell 3emlya is rooted in vanilla simplicity: a _320×200 screen resolution_, _classic vanilla physics_, and _compatibility with modern mapping standards such as MBF21 and ID24_. It is important to understand that the port is not intended to become something like **Eternity or ZDoom**. Here, you won’t find portals or polyobjects; the maximum “enhancement” available is 3D floors.

Nevertheless, the port provides modern features: colored sectors, an expanded arsenal of weapons and items, as well as support for more complex mapping.

Considering the trend of ports being developed primarily for players rather than mappers and modders, ** Hell 3emlya** fills a gap by offering a vanilla experience with contemporary improvements.
